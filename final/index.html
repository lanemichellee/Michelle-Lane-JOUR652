    <div class="chapter-title">About the Project</div>

<p class="chapter-text">The University of Maryland has a variety of large construction projects currently taking place on the College Park campus. These recent developments include the construction of the Iribe Center, the renovation of Cole Fieldhouse, and the Metrorail Purple Line project.</p>

<p class="chapter-text">The largest of the current campus construction projects is the new Metrorail Purple Line, a light rail line that will cut across campus and is estimated to cost a total of 2.2 billion dollars. The project description as provided by the Maryland Transit Administration states that the project will include track stations, railcars, and two operation and maintenance facilities. The Maryland Transit Administration has defined the project Purpose & Need Summary Statement as listed below.</p>

<p class="quote">
    <em>"The Purple Line will provide faster, more reliable transportation between residential and major employment areas. It will enhance access to existing radial Metrorail lines, increase capacity of congested roadways, support economic development consistent with local master plans, and reduce environmental impacts"<br>-Maryland Transit Administration</em>
</p>
<!--CLOSE quote-->

<p class="chapter-text">The new rail line is expected to start service in 2022 and will impact the University of Maryland’s campus traffic patterns and university operations. The project will change the visual appearance of the campus and will make the campus more accessible to the surrounding community.</p>

<p class="chapter-text">In addition to impacting College Park, the Purple Line will affect the Montgomery County and Prince George’s County communities. The 16.2-mile light rail line will travel through campus and will have 21 stations spanning from Bethesda, Md. in Montgomery County to New Carrollton, Md. in Prince George’s County. All of the Purple Line stations are shown in the map below.</p>

<p class="chapter-text">The Purple Line will connect to the Red Line, Green Line, and Orange Line of the Metrorail systems, and will also connect to the MARC and Amtrak commuter rail systems. The Maryland Department of Transportation estimates that the Purple Line will have 69,000 total daily riders in 2030 and 74,000 daily riders in 2040.</p>

<p class="chapter-text">With this new opportunity for commuters to utilize rail lines for travel, the Purple Line is anticipated to take thousands of vehicles off surrounding roadways. In a message from the University of Maryland’s Division of Administration & Finance, the sustainability goals in relation to the project were addressed.</p>

<p class="quote2">
    <em>“As construction of the Purple Line ramps up on campus this fall, Campus Drive will transition into a one-way, west-bound only road. This will be a permanent change to the way traffic flows through the center of campus.”<br>-Linda Clement, Vice President for Student Affairs<br>Carlo Colella, Vice President for Administration & Finance</em>
</p>
<!--CLOSE quote 2-->

<p class="chapter-text">While the construction can be an inconvenience, the growing campus population and vehicle congestion is an issue that needs to be addressed. Student enrollment at the University of Maryland, College Park has continually increased from 2013 through 2017.</p>

<p class="chapter-text">If enrollment rates continue to rise, accessibility to campus will continue to be a significant administrative challenge. Direct access to the campus via the Purple Line could accommodate increased numbers of students, faculty, and staff traveling toward College Park.</p>

<p class="chapter-text">As of the Fall 2018 semester, the USM Institutional Research Information System reported that Montgomery County and Prince George’s County have a higher number of students enrolled than most other counties in the state, which is the geographical area serviced by the Purple Line.</p>

<p class="chapter-text">The Purple Line will be a commuting option for the large quantity of students living in the Montgomery County and Prince George’s County areas that need to access campus. The Purple Line’s connections to other rail lines including the MARC and Amtrak systems will also give students access to the resources in Washington D.C. and other surrounding metropolitan areas.</p>

<!--OPEN quote-->
<p class="quote"><em>“As a student here at the university, I think that the Purple Line will actually be a great asset to the University moving forward. I think the growing pains of the construction is what is most frustrating right now, but the end result will only benefit the campus community and the other communities in a positive way.”<br>-Dimas R. Syuardi</em>

<p class="chapter-text">While construction is currently underway, there is still a substantial amount of work that needs to be completed before the Purple Line will be in service. The timeline below highlights some of the substantial project milestones as defined by the Department of Transportation Maryland Transit Administration. If the project stays on schedule, the Purple Line is expected to be open for service in 2022.</p>
