<p class="chapter-text">The largest of the current campus construction projects is the new Metrorail Purple Line, a light rail line that will cut across campus and is estimated to cost a total of 2.2 billion dollars. The project description as provided by the Maryland Transit Administration states that the project will include track stations, railcars, and two operation and maintenance facilities. The Maryland Transit Administration has defined the project Purpose & Need Summary Statement as listed below.</p>

<!--OPEN quote-->
  <p class="quote">
    <em>"The Purple Line will provide faster, more reliable transportation between residential and major employment areas. It will enhance access to existing radial Metrorail lines, increase capacity of congested roadways, support economic development consistent with local master plans, and reduce environmental impacts"<br>-Maryland Transit Administration</em>
  </p>
<!--CLOSE quote-->

<p class="chapter-text">The new rail line is expected to start service in 2022 and will impact the University of Maryland’s campus traffic patterns and university operations. The project will change the visual appearance of the campus and will make the campus more accessible to the surrounding community.</p>

<p class="chapter-text">When current University of Maryland student, Jermaine Rowley, was asked about his opinion on the construction of the Purple Line and the plans for the new Metrorail to run across campus, he acknowledged that there could be some benefits. “I believe many people won’t feel the need to drive and park at this university due to the Purple Line,” said Rowley. “Both driving and parking can be an extreme hassle so to lessen that need will be great. Of course, it will also benefit commuter students because it could replace an extra bus or car ride for free.”</p>

<p class="chapter-text">Rowley does have concerns about the physical changes happening on campus due to the construction involved with the Purple Line project. The University of Maryland made an announcement in May 2018 to inform the public of their plans to relocated the M Circle to make way for the Purple Line. The decision has been considered widely controversial by members of the University of Maryland community that consider the M Circle to be iconic and a key landmark on campus. “The relocation of the M Circle is extremely unfortunate and upsetting. The location is a huge staple of the University of Maryland and its culture,” said Rowley.</p>

<p class="chapter-text">In addition to impacting College Park, the Purple Line will affect the Montgomery County and Prince George’s County communities. The 16.2-mile light rail line will travel through campus and will have 21 stations spanning from Bethesda, Md. in Montgomery County to New Carrollton, Md. in Prince George’s County. All of the Purple Line stations are shown in the map below.</p>

<p class="chapter-text">The Purple Line will connect to the Red Line, Green Line, and Orange Line of the Metrorail systems, and will also connect to the MARC and Amtrak commuter rail systems. The Maryland Department of Transportation estimates that the Purple Line will have 69,000 total daily riders in 2030 and 74,000 daily riders in 2040.</p>

<p class="chapter-text">With this new opportunity for commuters to utilize rail lines for travel, the Purple Line is anticipated to take thousands of vehicles off surrounding roadways. "When there is an event and traffic is heavy or when classes get out and there is a lot of foot traffic in the crosswalks it can be very challenging to get around College Park in a car. I will definitely consider the Purple Line as an option to get across campus when it is open," said a current University of Maryland staff member, Jimmy Sheptock. In a message from the University of Maryland’s Division of Administration & Finance, the sustainability goals in relation to the project were addressed.</p>

Dimas Syuardi, a University of Maryland student that takes classes and also has a job working on the College Park campus, believes the new metro rail will be a positive addition. When asked about the Purple Line, Syuardi replied, “As a student here at the university, I think that the Purple Line will actually be a great asset to the University moving forward. I think the growing pains of the construction is what is most frustrating right now, but the end result will only benefit the campus community and the other communities in a positive way.”
